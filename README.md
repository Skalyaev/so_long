# So Long
> *And thanks for all the fish!*

*Being a developer is a great thing for creating your own game.*
*But a good game needs some good assets.*
*In order to create 2D games, you will have to search for tiles, tilesets, sprites, and sprite sheets.*
*Fortunately, some talented artists are willing to share their works on platforms like: itch.io*
*In any case, try to respect other people’s work.*

## Objectives
> *This project is a very small 2D game.*
> *Its purpose is to make you work with textures, sprites, and some other very basic gameplay elements.*

It’s time for you to create a basic computer graphics project!
so long will help you improve your skills in the following areas: window management, event handling, colors, textures, and so forth.
You are going to use the school graphical library: the MiniLibX!
This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events.
The other goals are similar to every other goal for this first year: being rigorous, level up in C programming, use basic algorithms, do some information research, and so forth.

## How to use
> X11 needed.
```
sudo apt install libxext-dev libx11-dev libbsd-dev
